# deta
A metadata format for keeping track of files.

This is a human-readable format for storing information about files. This can be used in multiple situations; for example, the deta file can be stored along with the other files in a folder in order to make sure nothing is lost or corrupted.

deta is NOT suitable for a general filesystem tracker; being human-readable and plain text, it takes up much more space than a machine-readable format.

deta is formatted using the Speedy data format.
